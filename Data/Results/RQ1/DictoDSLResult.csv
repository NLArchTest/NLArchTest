ID,Rule,DictoDSL,Expressibility,Notes
1,"Classes that have name matching ""Dao"" should reside in a package ""..dao.."".","DaoClass: Class with name=""*Dao*""
DaoPkg: Class with package=""..dao..""
DaoClass must ResideIn(DaoPkg)",Fully Expressible,
2,"Classes that in ""..dao.."" should access Classes that are Assignable to ""EntityManager.class""","DaoPkg: Class with package=""..dao..""
EntityMgr: Class with name=""EntityManager""
DaoPkg must Access(EntityMgr)",Not Expressible,AssignableTo(EntityManager) uses type-level semantics; Dicto lacks a native type system; this expression suffers from severe semantic loss.
3,"Classes that are public should not depend on classes that residing in package ""..service.."".",,Not Expressible,Dicto has no public/visibility semantics.
4,"Classes that are public should not depend on classes that are assignable to ""EntityManager"".",,Not Expressible,Visibility + Type System Double Missing
5,"Classes that in the ""..impl.."" package should not be interfaces.",,Not Expressible,Dicto does not distinguish between interface/class kind.
6,"Classes residing in the ""..persistence.."" package should not access any classes in the ""..service.."" package.","Persistence: Class with package=""..persistence..""
Service: Class with package=""..service..""
Persistence cannot Access(Service)",Fully Expressible,
7,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only be accessed by classes in the ""..controller.."" or ""..service.."" packages","Service: Class with package=""..service..""
Controller: Class with package=""..controller..""
Service must BeAccessedBy(Controller)
Service must BeAccessedBy(Service)",Partially Expressible,Dicto has no only/closed-world semantics; it cannot prevent access from other packages.
8,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should access classes that in ""..service.."", ""..persistence.."", or ""java.."" package.",,Partially Expressible,"Dicto can write to multiple Access objects, but it cannot block other access targets."
9,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should not depend on classes in the ""..controller.."" package","Service: Class with package=""..service..""
Controller: Class with package=""..controller..""
Service cannot DependOn(Controller)",Fully Expressible,
10,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only have dependent classes in the ""..controller.."" or ""..service.."" packages.",,Partially Expressible,"Dicto cannot express ""prohibit other dependencies""."
11,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only depend on classes in ""..service.."", ""..persistence.."", ""java.."", or ""javax.."" packages",,Partially Expressible,"Dicto cannot express ""prohibit other dependencies""."
12,"Classes that In ""..service.."" package should not depend on classes that in package ""..persistence..""","Service: Class with package=""..service..""
Persistence: Class with package=""..persistence..""
Service cannot DependOn(Persistence)",Fully Expressible,
13,"Classes that In package ""..service.."" should only depend on classes that in package ""..persistence.."" and ""..controller..""",,Partially Expressible,Dicto's ability to have no closed dependency domain
14,"Classes that have name matching ""Dao"" should only depend on classes that in a package ""..dao.."".",,Partially Expressible,Dicto's ability to have no closed dependency domain
15,No class should depend on an upper package.,"LowerClass: Class with package=""com.company.util.helper.*""
UpperPackage: Package with name=""com.company.util""
LowerClass cannot DependOn(UpperPackage)",Partially Expressible,Dicto cannot represent a collection of classes; it can be expressed using specific class names or package names.
