1,"Classes that have name matching ""Dao"" should reside in a package ""..dao.."".","class(match("".*Dao.*"")) should resideIn(""..dao.."")",Fully Expressible,,
2,"Classes that in ""..dao.."" should access Classes that are Assignable to ""EntityManager.class""",,Not Expressible,Guarding No type hierarchy/assignable query; can only match by specific class name (semantic loss).。,
3,"Classes that are public should not depend on classes that residing in package ""..service.."".","class(match(""modifier=\""public\"""")) should not depend class(""..service.."")",Fully Expressible,,
4,"Classes that are public should not depend on classes that are assignable to ""EntityManager"".",,Not Expressible,Type-hierarchy lookup is required; Guarding does not support it.,
5,"Classes that in the ""..impl.."" package should not be interfaces.","class(""..impl.."") should not be interface",Not Expressible,Guarding cannot directly detect whether it is an interface/class-kind.,
6,"Classes residing in the ""..persistence.."" package should not access any classes in the ""..service.."" package.","class(""..persistence.."") should not access class(""..service.."")",Fully Expressible,,
7,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only be accessed by classes in the ""..controller.."" or ""..service.."" packages","class(""..service.."") should only accessedBy(class(""..controller..""), class(""..service..""))",Partial Expressible,"Guarding can express ""the accessed party comes from controller/service"" (write approximate rules), but it does not support only (closed/exclusive semantics), and cannot prevent other packages from accessing it.",
8,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should access classes that in ""..service.."", ""..persistence.."", or ""java.."" package.",,Partial Expressible,"A positive request to ""should access"" can be expressed using multiple ""should access"" statements.",
9,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should not depend on classes in the ""..controller.."" package","class(""..service.."") should not depend class(""..controller.."")",Fully Expressible,,
10,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only have dependent classes in the ""..controller.."" or ""..service.."" packages.","class(""..service.."") should only dependBy(...)",Partial Expressible,"Same as #7: Cannot express ""only / exclusive"", can only partially express the set of receivers.",
11,"Classes in the ""..service.."" package should only depend on classes in ""..service.."", ""..persistence.."", ""java.."", or ""javax.."" packages","class(""..service.."") should only depend (...)",Partial Expressible,"Guarding can list allowed dependency targets, but cannot prohibit other dependencies (lacking only semantics).",
12,"Classes that In ""..service.."" package should not depend on classes that in package ""..persistence..""","class(""..service.."") should not depend class(""..persistence.."")",Fully Expressible,,
13,"Classes that In package ""..service.."" should only depend on classes that in package ""..persistence.."" and ""..controller..""","class(""..service.."") should only depend (class(""..persistence..""), class(""..controller..""))",Partial Expressible,It is impossible to represent a closed set.,
14,"Classes that have name matching ""Dao"" should only depend on classes that in a package ""..dao.."".","class(match("".*Dao.*"")) should only depend class(""..dao.."")",Partial Expressible,"The ""only"" keyword lacks closed semantics, thus it is partial (allowed targets can be listed, but other dependencies cannot be prohibited).",
15,No class should depend on an upper package.,class() should not depend upperPackage(),Partial Expressible,"The term ""upper package"" is vague and Guarding has no built-in concept; it requires semantic hierarchy/package level operation support.",
